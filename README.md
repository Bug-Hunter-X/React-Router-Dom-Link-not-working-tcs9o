# React Router Dom Link not working
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `Link` component from `react-router-dom`. The navigation between pages is not functioning as expected.
The problem is due to an improper usage of the `Link` component and the path provided. 
The solution involves ensuring that the path provided to the `Link` component is correct in relation to the routes defined in your `Routes` component and that you are importing the necessary components from `react-router-dom` correctly.
